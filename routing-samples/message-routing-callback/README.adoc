## Spring Cloud Stream Message Routing Sample

Demo for MessageRoutingCallback.

### Running the app

Make sure that you have Kafka running.

Run the main class - `MessageRoutingApplication`. You should see the following in the console output.

```
Menu(id=null, name=null)
```

and

```
Order(id=null, price=null)
```

The `CustoMessageRoutingCallback` examines each method sent to the routing function (`functionRouter`) and then route to the appropriate function.
The main class sends two messages - one for `Menu` and another for `Order` - to the `functionRouter-in-0` topic which is intercepted by the routing callback for invoking the correct function.
