# Gotchas when running multiple pollable consumers

## Problem Statement

How can I run multiple instances of the pollable consumers and generate unique client.id for each instance?

## Solution

Assuming that I have the following definition:

```
spring.cloud.stream.pollable-source: foo
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.foo-in-0.group: my-group
```

When running the application, the Kafka consumer generates a client.id (something like `consumer-my-group-1`).
For each instance of the application that is running, this `client.id` will be the same, causing unexpected issues.

In order to fix this, you can add the following property on each instance of the application:

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.foo-in-0.consumer.configuration.client.id=${client.id}
```
