# Explain how offset resetting work in Kafka Streams binder

## Problem Statement

By default, Kafka Streams binder always starts from the earliest offset for a new consumer.
Sometimes, it is beneficial or required by the application to start from the latest offset.
Kafka Streams binder allows you to do that.

## Solution

Before we look at the solution, let us look at the following scenario.

```
@Bean
public BiConsumer<KStream<Object, Object>, KTable<Object, Object>> myBiConsumer{
    (s, t) -> s.join(t, ...)
    ...
}
```

We have a `BiConsumer` bean that requires two input bindings.
In this case, the first binding is for a `KStream` and the second one is for a `KTable`.
When running this application for the first time, by default, both bindings start from the `earliest` offset.
What about I want to start from the `latest` offset due to some requirements?
You can do this by enabling the following properties.

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.myBiConsumer-in-0.consumer.startOffset: latest
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.bindings.myBiConsumer-in-1.consumer.startOffset: latest
```

If you want only one binding to start from the `latest` offset and the other to consumer from the default `earliest`, then leave the latter binding out from the configuration.

Keep in mind that, once there are committed offsets, these setting are *not* honored and the committed offsets take precedence.
