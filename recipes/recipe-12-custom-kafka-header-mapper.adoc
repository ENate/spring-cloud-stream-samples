# Adding custom header mapper in Kafka

## Problem Statement

I have a Kafka producer application that sets some headers, but they are missing in the consumer application. Why is that?

## Solution

Under normal circumstances, this should be fine.

Imagine, you have the following producer.

```
@Bean
public Supplier<Message<String>> supply() {
    return () -> MessageBuilder.withPayload("foo").setHeader("foo", "bar").build();
}
```

On the consumer side, you should still see the header "foo", and the following should not give you any issues.

```
@Bean
public Consumer<Message<String>> consume() {
    return s -> {
        final String foo = (String)s.getHeaders().get("foo");
        System.out.println(foo);
    };
}
```

If you provide a https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka/docs/3.1.3/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka.html#_kafka_binder_properties[custom header mapper] in the application, then this won't work.
Let's say you have an empty `KafkaHeaderMapper` in the application.

```
@Bean
public KafkaHeaderMapper kafkaBinderHeaderMapper() {
    return new KafkaHeaderMapper() {
        @Override
        public void fromHeaders(MessageHeaders headers, Headers target) {

        }

        @Override
        public void toHeaders(Headers source, Map<String, Object> target) {

        }
    };
}
```

If that is your implementation, then you will miss the `foo` header on the consumer.
Chances are that, you may have some logic inside those `KafkaHeaderMapper` methods.
You need the following to populate the `foo` header.

```
@Bean
public KafkaHeaderMapper kafkaBinderHeaderMapper() {
    return new KafkaHeaderMapper() {
        @Override
        public void fromHeaders(MessageHeaders headers, Headers target) {
            final String foo = (String) headers.get("foo");
            target.add("foo", foo.getBytes());
        }

        @Override
        public void toHeaders(Headers source, Map<String, Object> target) {
            final Header foo = source.lastHeader("foo");
			target.put("foo", new String(foo.value()));
        }
    }
```

That will properly populate the `foo` header from the producer to consumer.

## Special note on the id header

In Spring Cloud Stream, the `id` header is a special header, but some applications may want to have special custom id headers - something like `custom-id` or `ID` or `Id`.
The first one (`custom-id`) will propagate without any custom header mapper from producer to consumer.
However, if you produce with a variant of the framework reserved `id` header - such as `ID`, `Id`, `iD` etc. then you will run into issues with the internals of the framework.
See this StackOverflow thread fore more context on this use case: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68412600/change-the-behaviour-in-spring-cloud-stream-make-header-matcher-case-sensitive
In that case, you must use a custom `KafkaHeaderMapper` to map the case-sensitive id header.
For example, let's say you have the following producer.

```
@Bean
public Supplier<Message<String>> supply() {
    return () -> MessageBuilder.withPayload("foo").setHeader("Id", "my-id").build();
}
```

The header `Id` above will be gone from the consuming side as it clashes with the framework `id` header.
You can provide a custom `KafkaHeaderMapper` to solve this issue.

```
@Bean
public KafkaHeaderMapper kafkaBinderHeaderMapper1() {
    return new KafkaHeaderMapper() {
        @Override
        public void fromHeaders(MessageHeaders headers, Headers target) {
            final String myId = (String) headers.get("Id");
			target.add("Id", myId.getBytes());
        }

        @Override
        public void toHeaders(Headers source, Map<String, Object> target) {
            final Header Id = source.lastHeader("Id");
			target.put("Id", new String(Id.value()));
        }
    };
}
```

By doing this, both `id` and `Id` headers will be available from the producer to the consumer side.
