# Keeping track of successful sending of records (producing) in Kafka

## Problem Statement

I have a Kafka producer application and I want to keep track of all my successful sedings.

## Solution

Let us assume that we have this following supplier in the application.

```
@Bean
	public Supplier<Message<String>> supplier() {
		return () -> MessageBuilder.withPayload("foo").setHeader(KafkaHeaders.MESSAGE_KEY, "my-foo").build();
	}
```

Then, we need to define a new `MessageChannel` bean to capture all the successful send information.

```
@Bean
	public MessageChannel fooRecordChannel() {
		return new DirectChannel();
	}
```

Next, define this property in the application configuration to provide the bean name for the `recordMetadataChannel`.

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.supplier-out-0.producer.recordMetadataChannel: fooRecordChannel
```

At this point, successful sent information will be sent to the `fooRecordChannel`.

You can write an `IntegrationFlow` as below to see the information.

```
@Bean
public IntegrationFlow integrationFlow() {
    return f -> f.channel("fooRecordChannel")
                 .handle((payload, messageHeaders) -> payload);
}
```

In the `handle` method, the payload is what got sent to Kafka and the message headers contain a special key called `kafka_recordMetadata`.
Its value is a `RecordMetadata` that contains information about topic partition, current offset etc.
